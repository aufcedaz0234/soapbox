# Trivia

- The original code that made up soapbox was lost when the HDD crashed/failed.
- soapbox had two potential names at the time, broadcast and platform.
- The creator of soapbox originally had planned for the creation of a social network known as TheNetwerk back in 2013.
- TheNetwerk project/concept was then renamed in 2014 to Oped a portmanteau of Open Education, based on a social network dedicated to free world-wide education.
- TheNetwerk and Oped were to utilize node.js, along with Soapbox. However, the need for a free local server and something that could allow for deployment on the creator's main machine was a factor in Soapbox being written in PHP.
